# How to run this application
* Clone the repo.
* Install the dependencies by navigating to the project root directory and running `npm install`.
* Start the application by running `npm start`.
* Follow the three prompts.
    * The first prompt asks "`Where is the file located?`". Provide the complete relative file path along with the file name. There are two files in this repository that can be used as input: `users.csv` and `users.tsv`. If you want to use one of those files, then you can enter one of the following file paths
        * `users.csv`
        * `./users.csv`
        * `users.tsv`
        * `./users.tsv`
* Output files. After you have answered all three prompts, you will see one or two of the four possible output files appear in the project directory:
    * `output-correct-format.csv`
    * `output-incorrect-format.csv`
    * `output-correct-format.tsv`
    * `output-incorrect-format.tsv`

NOTE: Each time you run the application, the output files are deleted and new ones are created in their place.
